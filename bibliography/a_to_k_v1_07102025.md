I picked up a softcover of this volume new in a discount bin for a steal circa four (4) years post-publication. So, in circa 2006. I read it completely a number of times and referred to it often. For the genre, it is exceptionally well executed. I recommend without caveat. I read it initially to inform my cosmetic and topical application and usage of oils as I didn't want to use proprietary products. I wish I had taken greater interest in and applied its culinary and nutritional knowledge. But, \*stoopidly*, I continued to eat [Nuttelex](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nuttelex&oldid=1306567531) 'till this year and have now, finally, returned to butter. My softcover, long ago, went A.W.O.L./M.I.A., like so many of my books. I could not remember either the author's name nor the title, which vexed me as I thought about it a number of times over the years. But, whilst having a bath with sweet almond oil circa three (3) days ago, the cover page with the title entered my mind's eye and here are the saliences as a result.
