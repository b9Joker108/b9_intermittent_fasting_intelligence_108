**Purport:**<br>
I picked this volume up new in a discount bin for a steal circa four (4) years post-publication. So, circa 2006. I read it more to inform my cosmetic and topical usage of oils. My softcover, long ago, went A.W.O.L./M.I.A. I could not remember either the author nor the title, wh*ch vexed me. But, whilst having a bath with sweet almond oil circa three (3) days ago, the cover page with the title entered my mind's eye and here are the saliences as a result.
