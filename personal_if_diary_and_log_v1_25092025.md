# Personal Intermittent Fasting (IF) Diary and Log #

Rationale: The personal log is useful as data for self-reflexivity and data mining and for coding this repository.

I finished editing yesterday's log at circa 12.30am. I rested in bed and breathed with eyes closed until 'Vedic Awaken' chimed at 4.00am. I then commenced my day. A personal anecdote. When I was circa 10, I was spending a few days with my paternal grandmother, Isabel, and my great aunt, her sister, Ruby, in Essendon. My grandmother was intending to take me to Puckle Street, but I don't remember ever going. Anyway, I slept next to my grandmother, Nanna, in her huge bedv underwhich she saved AUD .01 and .02 cent coins, the coppers, for me, which she deposited every few weeks in a savings account for me she opened. Anyway, whilst we were in bed, we found we both do a curious thing with our feet. We individually rub our feet together as an inherent bedtime comforting actovity. My Nanna called it 'kneading', a metaphorical extension from baking. I have not done this for circa 5 years. Not since I returned to Australia from the United Kingdom. So, as a result of the 20 hour strict ketogenic fast, once again I started kneading in bed. It was lovely. I rested, but to my knowledge, did not sleep. I did domestic duties for two (2) hours and at just after 6.00am, set out to exert myself whilst fasting. A bit of running, jogging, sprinting, Fartlek Protocol, stretching, limbering, joing rotations, static holds and balancework. I just maintained a gentle, yet decisive, burn and raised my core temperature, to my extremities and once again, staked training zones, thst is areas or locales of support for a given bodywork type. Home again, domestic duties, hydrated, bootstrapped ketogenesys with MCT oil with some matcha. Entered this log. Next into my home Mandhir (temple room) to initiate a Kettlebell (Giriwork) Protocol. I must signal to my bodily and systemic intelligence, what is of value in my body, so it is not 'rationalised' or 'decommisioned', eg.: musculature, for example. I have been fasting for just over 13 hours and am not hungry, even though domestic duties have consisted of processing and preparing fresh primary ingredients: vegetables. I have also done some administration, attended to my beloved Deities and my internal garden. Today, I will recommence orchestral glockenspiel bhajana and the weblog of that GitHub repository: https://github.com/b9Joker108/a_glockenspiel_magistery/tree/main/sadhana_practice_diary_and_log and I will also do an audiolog on SoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/benign-hummingbird-hovering

At, the point of 17.5 hours of the strict keto fast, I resolved to breakfast with a pear. Very quickly post-pear my light-headedness ceased, due to the brief glucose release into my bloodstream. Then, in circa 15 minutes, I found myself drinking an organic kefir lassi, with fresh, wild, organic, unreconstituted pomegranite juice and a dash of ground nutmeg. I had a double-portion of what would be had if the juice was cordial proper. I drink fruit juice as a cordial. Presently, the only juices I take are dashes: lime, lemon, orange and pomegranite. I love Ribena Lite, but have weaned myself off it. I never drank it often, maybe once every circa 10 days at minimum. With the pomegranite and nutmeg kefir lassi, first I took a quarter of a teaspoon of ground dried organic whole rosehip fruit subsuming seeds under my tongue and let in bypass the liver and swilled and swished it with my saliva around my mouth and most of it had dissapated (?) prior to chasing it with the lassi and vitamins. I took my vitamins (and medication, which I refer to as vitamins) and then found myself eating an apple cut in slices with a cottage cheese dip of organic hemp seeds, dried currants, organic cocao nibs and organic food-grade rose petals. I feel, I will now have some collagen and then a level teaspoon of Creatine Monohydrate taken under the tongue, then after two minutes, swill around the mouth with saliva, just as I did with the collagen. Then, in circa 15 minutes, I had around thirty (30) toasted and salted, whole, unhulled sunflower seeds. An exercise in appropriate chewing. That closes a fruitful breakfast with easily and rapidly digestible cow dairy proteins. Gut microbiome supported, increased and nourished. I just offered two meat preparations, had a taste of the kill and then individually packaged and most, put on ice and one (1) in fridge. Now, to giriwork, as all portions were modest and rapidly digestible bar the sunflower seeds and the daylight is beginning to draw to a close. It is almost 3.00pm. After kettlebells, protein and vegetables, which is already all prepared and offered. Giriwork was pre-simple sans sinister. It was really, greasing the groove of greasing the groove and much adout about nothing. No bellplay either. At minimum, it was a profoundly humble and humbling beginning. It is just post-4.00pm and I pressed Fasting Protocol 20. I don't know where I will get to, but a fasting phase of a minimum of 13 hours is standard with exceptionalism as absolutely necessary. I would have liked to commence external bhajan bellplay today, but I am compelled to rest.

My first IF was supposed to be a strict ketogenic fasting phase of 13 hours. At thirteen hours, I understand there are subtle cascades through metabolic pathways, that are cummulative if the 13 hour fasting phase is repeated by aggregate. Due to circumstance, I ended up doing a strict ketogenic fast for 20 hours. It was nether uncomfortable nor difficult. I have a feasting phase protocol and a fasting phase protocol. It appears that the human energetic metabolic system is discretely bifurcated, like an analogue and/or digital switch. A given human is either in a feasting phase or fasting phase at all times. At present, to my knowledge, there is no evidence that this binary phase is problematised or further reducable or quantum, for example. At 20 hours, I broke my fast, the fasting phase, with the breakfast (fast breaking) protocol. So, I ended up in the feasting phase doing One-Meal-A-Day (OMAD). This, was nether planned nor anticipated. It was through force of circumstance. I feasted with neither cereal nor grain, nor starch-dominant foods. Carbohydrates, were presentv naturally, in all whole foods eaten, to some degree, bar MTC oil and EVOO. To my mind, there is a clear order of precedence to the three (3) dietary macronutrients of the human. As before stated: there is a feasting phase and a fasting phase. Of the three (3) macronutrients, two (2) are essential. Essential means that the human biological and metabolic system, according to current attested and defensable discourse, cannot self-generate a given resourse in the human biological-dietary-energetic-system and must source it from without, that is, externally. Of the two (2) essential macronutrients, only fats and oils are beneficial, healthy and aporopriate, in both the feasting and fasting phase. Protein, as an essential macronutrient, will, through the digestive process, shift a given person (as a general rule, from a fasting phase to a feasting phase. Once, appropriate fats and oils are determined and qualified, they are the only macronutrient that is germane to both phases of the human dietary energetic system (as a general rule). Carbohydrates are the only macronutrient(s) that are not essential and the body may both secure them from without and/or generate them from an arcanum within. Carbohydrates will switch a given pers(n, in general, from a fasting phase to a feasting phase. This is simplistic, rudimentary and there is, of course, exceptionalism. So, with the given sketch herewith, I proffer that the order of precedence of macronutrients is: (1) fats and oils (as defined); (2) proteins and amino acids (as defined); and (3) carbohydrates (as defined). Most natural foods will be dominated by one (1) of these macronutrients. That said, all natural foods, as a general rule, are not macronutrient-specific or macronutrient-discrete. For example, even appropriate fats and oils, if overconsumed, will compromise both phases: feasting and fasting. For me, this is all unusually badly written. I have noted, when I breakfasted and started digesting, my stomach was signalling to me without equivocation, that it was going through a process that was non-standard to the prevailing personal metabolic status quo. I understand, at the circa 20 hour fasting phase, that new stem cells are produced in the stomach lining. I feel, this is what I felt. I had a few very quick eliminations in sequence. Now, nothing was non-standard in my day escept for intermittent fasting for 20 hours. After feasting OMAD, I set the timer immediately for another fasting phase of 20 hours. On walking after my meal, I noticed much of interest and import. My archilles tendon was tight. My ankles inner and outer of both feet were sensitized. My thighs were tight in both legs as were my glutes in both legs. It was like I had exercised substantively, and yet, I had not. I do not have significant love-handles, but they were both sensitized, as were the perpendicular spinal stapalizers just interior to them. End transmission.
