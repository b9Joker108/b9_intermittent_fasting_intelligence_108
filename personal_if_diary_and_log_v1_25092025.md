# Personal Intermittent Fasting (IF) Diary and Log #

Rationale: The personal log is useful as data for self-reflexivity and data mining and for coding this repository.

My first IF was supposed to be a strict ketogenic fasting phase of 13 hours. At thirteen hours, I understand there are subtle cascades through metabolic pathways, that are cummulative if the 13 hour fasting phase is repeated by aggregate. Due to circumstance, I ended up doing a strict ketogenic fast for 20 hours. It was nether uncomfortable nor difficult. I have a feasting phase protocol and a fasting phase protocol. It appears that the human energetic metabolic system is discretely bifurcated, like an analogue and/or digital switch. A given human is either in a feasting phase or fasting phase at all times. At present, to my knowledge, there is no evidence that this binary phase is problematised or quantum, for example. At 20 hours, I broke my fast, the fasting phase, with the breakfast (fast breaking) protocol. So, I ended up in the feasting phase doing One-Meal-A-Day (OMAD). I feasted with neither cereal nor grain. To my mind, there is a clear order of precedence to the three (3) dietary macronutrients of the human. As before stated: there is a feasting phase and a fasting phase. Of the three (3) macronutrients, two (2) are essential. Essential means that the human biological and metabolic system, according to current attested and defensable discourse, cannot self-generate a given resourse in the human biological-dietary-energetic-system and must source it from without, that is, externally. Of the two (2) essential macronutrients, only fats and oils are beneficial, healthy and aporopriate, in both the feasting and fasting phase. Protein, as an essential macronutrient, will, through the digestive process, shift a given person (as a general rule, from a fasting phase to a feasting phase. Once, appropriate fats and oils are determined and qualified, they are the only macronutrient that is germane to both phases of the human dietary energetic system (as a general rule). Carbohydrates are the only macronutrient(s) that are not essential and the body may both secure them from without and/or generate them from an arcanum within. Carbohydrates will switch a given pers(n, in general, from a fasting phase to a feasting phase. This is simplistic, rudimentary and there is, of course, exceptionalism. So, with the given sketch herewith, I proffer that the order of precedence of macronutrients is: (1) fats and oils (as defined); (2) proteins and amino acids (as defined); and (3) carbohydrates (as defined). Most natural foods will be dominated by one (1) of these macronutrients. That said, all natural foods, as a general rule, are not macronutrient-specific or macronutrient-discrete. For example, even appropriate fats and oils, if overconsumed, will compromise both phases: feasting and fasting. For me, this is all unusually badly written. I have noted, when I breakfasted and started digesting, my stomach was signalling to me without equivocation, that it was going through a process that was non-standard to the prevailing personal metabolic status quo. I understand, at the circa 20 hour fasting phase, that new stem cells are produced in the stomach lining. I feel, this is what I felt. I had a few very quick eliminations in sequence. Now, nothing was non-standard in my day escept for intermittent fasting for 20 hours. After feasting OMAD, I set the timer immediately for another fasting phase of 20 hours. On walking after my meal, I noticed much of interest and import. My archilles tendon was tight. My ankles inner and outer of both feet were sensitized. My thighs were tight in both legs as were my glutes in both legs. It was like I had exercised substantively, and yet, I had not. I do not have significant love-handles, but they were both sensitized, as were the perpendicular spinal stapalizers just interior to them. End transmission.
