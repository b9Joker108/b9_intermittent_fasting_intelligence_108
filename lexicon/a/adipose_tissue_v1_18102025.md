# Adipose Tissue #

Human adipose tissue stores energy almost exclusively as triglycerides. Triglycerides are the main constituents of body fat in humans and other vertebrates. In a lean young adult, adipose depots contain roughly 10–20 kg of triglycerides (equivalent to about 90,000–180,000 kcal of energy), highlighting that these molecules form the vast bulk of stored fat. Triglycerides make up over 95 percent of all lipid mass in the body; the remaining few percent consists of cholesterol esters, phospholipids, and small amounts of free fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins.

Adipose tissue accumulates certain toxins; specifically, those that are lipophilic (fat-loving). These compounds dissolve in, and become sequestered by, the lipid droplets inside adipocytes rather than circulating freely in blood or water-based compartments.

Key toxins stored in fat include:  
- Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)  
- Organochlorine pesticides (e.g. DDT and its metabolites)  
- Some hydrophobic industrial chemicals and flame retardants  

Because these substances resist metabolic breakdown, adipose depots can serve both as a long-term reservoir and, upon fat mobilization, a source that slowly leaches toxins back into the bloodstream.

Mechanisms and health implications:  
- During weight loss or lipolysis, lipophilic toxins are released and may transiently elevate blood levels, exposing organs like the liver, brain and kidneys.  
- In acute exposures, fat storage can be protective by limiting toxin distribution to more vulnerable tissues.  
- Chronically, low-grade release contributes to endocrine disruption, inflammation and metabolic disturbances.  

Understanding this storage-release dynamic is crucial for evaluating risks during rapid weight loss, for designing detoxification strategies and for assessing long-term health effects of environmental pollutants.
