# Adipose Tissue #

Human adipose tissue stores energy almost exclusively as triglycerides. Triglycerides are the main constituents of body fat in humans and other vertebrates. In a lean young adult, adipose depots contain roughly 10–20 kg of triglycerides (equivalent to about 90,000–180,000 kcal of energy), highlighting that these molecules form the vast bulk of stored fat. Triglycerides make up over 95 percent of all lipid mass in the body; the remaining few percent consists of cholesterol esters, phospholipids, and small amounts of free fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins.
