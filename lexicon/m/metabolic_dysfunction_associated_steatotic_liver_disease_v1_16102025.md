# Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) #

In 2023 an international group of doctors, scientists and patients announced that NAFLD would change its name to MASLD

Yes, in 2023, an international group of doctors, scientists, and patients announced the renaming of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) to Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD)[1][2][3].  

### Key Points about the Name Change
- The change was made to adopt a more affirmative, descriptive name that emphasizes metabolic dysfunction as the central cause, moving away from exclusionary and potentially stigmatizing terms like "nonalcoholic" and "fatty"[1][4].
- MASLD includes patients with hepatic steatosis and at least one of five defined cardiometabolic risk factors, reflecting the metabolic roots of the disease more precisely[1][2][6].
- Along with MASLD, the term Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH) replaces NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis)[2][3].
- The broader umbrella term "Steatotic Liver Disease" (SLD) covers various liver steatosis conditions, while a new category MetALD describes mixed metabolic and alcohol-related liver disease[1][2].

This international consensus, ratified by major liver societies such as the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), Latin American Liver Association (ALEH), and European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), was officially announced in June 2023 and publicized widely since[1][2].

This renaming reflects a shift towards reducing stigma and improving clarity in research, diagnosis, and treatment of fatty liver disease related to metabolic dysfunction[1][3].
