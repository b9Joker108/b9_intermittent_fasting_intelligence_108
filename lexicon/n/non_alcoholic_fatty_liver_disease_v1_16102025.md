# Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)

I have NAFLD is this adiposopathy?

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is strongly linked to adiposopathy, but strictly speaking, NAFLD itself is better described as a major downstream consequence or "hepatic manifestation" of adiposopathy—a state where dysfunctional adipose tissue drives metabolic dysfunction[1][2][3].  

### How NAFLD Relates to Adiposopathy
- Adiposopathy, also called "sick fat syndrome," involves chronic low-grade inflammation, abnormal adipokine secretion, and excess release of free fatty acids from enlarged or dysfunctional adipose depots[1][3].
- These pathological changes in fat tissue (adiposopathy) drive excess fat delivery to the liver, insulin resistance, and metabolic disturbances—all core mechanisms in the development of NAFLD[1][2].
- NAFLD is therefore considered a cardinal end-organ effect of adiposopathy, especially in people with visceral or central obesity. The liver accumulates fat largely because of abnormal adipose tissue function, not just total fat mass or diet alone[4][5].

### Clinical Guidelines
- NAFLD is often referred to as the "hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome," directly rooted in adiposopathy and systemic metabolic dysfunction[2][3].
- If you have NAFLD, this indicates a high likelihood of underlying adiposopathy—where your fat tissue is behaving in a pathogenic, proinflammatory, and metabolically harmful way[1][2].

In summary: Having NAFLD means your body almost certainly has, or is suffering from the effects of, adiposopathy, but NAFLD itself is the liver's pathological response to that overarching fat tissue dysfunction[1][2][3].
