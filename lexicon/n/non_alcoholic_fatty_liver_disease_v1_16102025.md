# Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)

I have NAFLD is this adiposopathy?

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is strongly linked to adiposopathy, but strictly speaking, NAFLD itself is better described as a major downstream consequence or "hepatic manifestation" of adiposopathy—a state where dysfunctional adipose tissue drives metabolic dysfunction[1][2][3].  

### How NAFLD Relates to Adiposopathy
- Adiposopathy, also called "sick fat syndrome," involves chronic low-grade inflammation, abnormal adipokine secretion, and excess release of free fatty acids from enlarged or dysfunctional adipose depots[1][3].
- These pathological changes in fat tissue (adiposopathy) drive excess fat delivery to the liver, insulin resistance, and metabolic disturbances—all core mechanisms in the development of NAFLD[1][2].
- NAFLD is therefore considered a cardinal end-organ effect of adiposopathy, especially in people with visceral or central obesity. The liver accumulates fat largely because of abnormal adipose tissue function, not just total fat mass or diet alone[4][5].

### Clinical Guidelines
- NAFLD is often referred to as the "hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome," directly rooted in adiposopathy and systemic metabolic dysfunction[2][3].
- If you have NAFLD, this indicates a high likelihood of underlying adiposopathy—where your fat tissue is behaving in a pathogenic, proinflammatory, and metabolically harmful way[1][2].

In summary: Having NAFLD means your body almost certainly has, or is suffering from the effects of, adiposopathy, but NAFLD itself is the liver's pathological response to that overarching fat tissue dysfunction[1][2][3].

In 2023 an international group of doctors, scientists and patients announced that NAFLD would change its name to MASLD

Yes, in 2023, an international group of doctors, scientists, and patients announced the renaming of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) to Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD)[1][2][3].  

### Key Points about the Name Change
- The change was made to adopt a more affirmative, descriptive name that emphasizes metabolic dysfunction as the central cause, moving away from exclusionary and potentially stigmatizing terms like "nonalcoholic" and "fatty"[1][4].
- MASLD includes patients with hepatic steatosis and at least one of five defined cardiometabolic risk factors, reflecting the metabolic roots of the disease more precisely[1][2][6].
- Along with MASLD, the term Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH) replaces NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis)[2][3].
- The broader umbrella term "Steatotic Liver Disease" (SLD) covers various liver steatosis conditions, while a new category MetALD describes mixed metabolic and alcohol-related liver disease[1][2].

This international consensus, ratified by major liver societies such as the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), Latin American Liver Association (ALEH), and European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), was officially announced in June 2023 and publicized widely since[1][2].

This renaming reflects a shift towards reducing stigma and improving clarity in research, diagnosis, and treatment of fatty liver disease related to metabolic dysfunction[1][3].
