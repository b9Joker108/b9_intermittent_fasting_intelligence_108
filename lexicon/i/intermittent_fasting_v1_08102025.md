# Intermittent Fasting #

Recent double-blind studies have revealed compelling evidence about fasting’s impact on metabolic health. For example, a 2022 Canadian study involving 150 participants showed that those following an intermittent fasting protocol experienced significant improvements in insulin sensitivity compared to the control group, even though neither group knew their assignment.  Can you identify the study?

The study referenced—an explicit 2022 Canadian double-blind trial with 150 participants that observed significant improvements in insulin sensitivity from intermittent fasting—cannot be uniquely identified or matched to a specific published article based on available indexed peer-reviewed literature and recognized databases. While numerous systematic reviews and meta-analyses published in recent years (including 2022 and 2025) strongly confirm that intermittent fasting improves insulin sensitivity and metabolic markers in diverse populations, there is no clear evidence of a single 2022 Canadian randomized controlled trial with precisely 150 participants and a double-blind intermittent fasting protocol where group assignment was blinded to participants[1][2][3].

A 2022 systematic review of clinical trials cited improvements in insulin resistance from intermittent fasting but did not refer to a double-blind Canadian study with exactly 150 participants[1]. Several review and primary studies from this period reported on the effects of intermittent fasting on insulin sensitivity, but none matched all the specifics of your description[4][3][5]. Therefore, either the study has been summarized differently in secondary sources, is unpublished, or is otherwise not indexed in the leading public biomedical repositories.

If you require the closest systematic, peer-reviewed evidence, please see:
- Yuan et al. (2022), demonstrating significant improvements in insulin sensitivity and other metabolic parameters after intermittent fasting in patients with metabolic syndrome[3].
- Systematic reviews and meta-analyses from 2022 and 2025 covering large populations, all concluding consistent benefits for insulin sensitivity, though not matching the exact protocol or demographic details described[1][6][5].

If further details (e.g., first author, precise protocol, or publication journal) can be provided, a more definitive identification may be possible.
