This repository is to capture and design an intelligent, learning, adaptive and self-corrective system and application for any given individual's intermittent fasting protocol(s), procedure(s), schedule(s), diary, testing, statistics, dynamic paramaters, knowledge base, web portal, etc., designed from first principles. By first principles, I intend: no assumptions, everything triangulated, everything policy driven, policy justified, strong governance for every determination and signoff.
